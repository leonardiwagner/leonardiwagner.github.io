## Why Debian Unstable over Debian Stable or Ubuntu?

Debian is officially released only every 2 years! That's the price to be rock-stable. Using dated software isn't a problem, the time-proof safety and focusing only on security rather than release new updates are the reasons to be the most popular Linux distribution on servers for almost 20 years!

However, enthusiasts like us prefer to swap a bit of stability to be using the latest software versions, so Debian has the Unstable release to solve that matter! It works as rolling-release, which means there are no release cycles, every day you have freshly made software updates!

Ubuntu is another option over Debian Stable but it isn't rolling-release, though it's released every 6 months only. It also comes with a lot of useless bloatware for novice users, which maybe isn't your case as well, so if you have an intermediate Linux knowledge stick with Debian Unstable!

## Why Debian Unstable over Arch Linux?

Now we have a real comparison! They are both rolling-release and without embedded bloatware, but I still have reasons to prefer Debian Unstable:

Almost every Linux software is officially distributed on *.deb packages.
Tons of answered questions, issues solved, and tutorials over the internet.
 It's backed by a large community and companies (such as Google!) with a lot of professionals working daily on it.
, moreover, you can use the same knowledge working on Debian and Ubuntu servers.
You can use the same acquired knowledge to work on Debian and Ubuntu servers.
Don't get me wrong, Arch Linux has a fair community and a lot of people are using their free time to maintain unofficial packages, however, it isn't the same thing, do you agree? On the other hand, Debian Unstable isn't an official distribution like Arch  (I'll explain that further), therefore Arch may be more stable sometimes because the maintainers are just focused on that release. So, if you don't have the same reasons I had to still choose Debian Unstable, go for Arch!

## Is the Debian Unstable distro.. unstable?

No, the Unstable distro is very stable actually, you can use it daily for a year without any problem at all, just like any other major Linux distribution. The name "unstable" simply exists because it's less stable than the official Debian Stable release, that's all! Don't worry about the name. 

I'm not saying that you won't face problems, I was using it for more than a year as my main distro (even for working) when I did an update which broke some apps. No Netflix session on that night! However, it was quickly fixed when I did another update in the morning.

Using a rolling-release distro doesn't imply that you should update every day! My recommendation is to update only after you finished all your work and learn how to rollback a broken update.

## Hey, wait, you didn't mention the Debian Testing!

Debian Testing is a release between Debian Stable and Debian Unstable. It sounds like a "perfect spot" to use Debian, right? WRONG, it's the worst option! Debian Testing contains only frozen states of Debian Unstable, which means if something is broken there, it'll stay broken for days (security issues included).

You may hear Ubuntu and other distros are based on Debian Testing, that's true but those distros are actually maintaining and caring about the health and security of their based state to the final-users, so always favor Ubuntu over Debian Testing.

## "Debian Unstable isn't an official release and it's not recommended for end-users."
I often read that argumentation and that's true! But first, let's understand the reasons: Debian has only one official release which is Debian Stable, that's the single thing they want to "sell". There's no desire to be bleeding-edge or rolling-release, their focus is to be stable and secure, so there's no reason to recommend using Unstable (even though their developers use it on their daily basis). Don't be afraid, Debian Unstable is just exactly what Debian Stable will become in the future.

Ironically it happens similarly with Fedora distro, which later will become Red Hat Linux, but both are released as official distributions, that's the difference. So don't stick with names, they may lead you to think wrong things.

So if you can spare some time and have at least intermediate Linux skills give Debian Unstable a try!
