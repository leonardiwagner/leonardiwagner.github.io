# What is functional programming?

Probably you program in some language such as C, Java, Python, Ruby, Javascript or similar. Do you think these languages are different? Actually they are from the same paradigm: **The Imperative**. Yes, synthax may be different, but you think in the same way to solve problems in any of these languages.

If the most popular programming languages are imperative, what is the another one paradigm? **The Functional**! The most popular functional languages are **Haskell, Lisp and Erlang**, and we have other languages that you can program in a functional way though is not purely functional, such as **Scala and F#**. 

I could say a lot of differences about the functional programming, but the most important is: state in functional programming is immutable. Which means, since you create things (eg.: a variable) you can't change its value. Only that make you change a lot your mindset to solve a problem in programming.

# Why functional programming?

We are hearing about functional programming more than ever. First, it's a very different model than most of popular programming, and we programmers are searching for new challenges more and more each day. Second and most important, as scalability is an increasing concern nowadays, functional programming concepts are very helpful to solve scalability problems.

The major issue with having multiple running instances on the cloud, or concurrent threads in a processor is dealing with the mutable state. Only by the fact of not having mutable state in functional programming, most of these problems are solved by default. Mostly of software bugs are also orignated by unexpected results from mutable data. So, isn't wrong to say that a software written in a functional programming language will have less bugs than written with mutable data.


Also, most of bugs on software are originate from unexpected results from mutable data, 

# Paradigm shift

You probably learn to program this way: write instructions to computer that will be executed sequentially. Seems natural, right? But this model is only the one called **imperative programming** paradigm. All of popular programming languages, such as Java, Ruby, and C uses this paradigm, where you control the flow by `if`, `for` loops, and etc... but there's another paradigm named **declarative programming**. The most important difference between both is: in imperative paradigm you write **how** you want to solve a problem, however in declarative paradigm way you write **what** you want to achieve. Let's take a look:

Now you must be thinking, what does these paradigms matter to learn about functional programming? It's because functional programming uses the declarative paradigm. Usually people mix functional programming and declarative paradigm as being the same thing due most functional programming being declarive, but the opposite is not true. SQL for instance, is written as the declarative paradigm.

The most popular functional programmings are: Lisp, Haskell and Erlang.
