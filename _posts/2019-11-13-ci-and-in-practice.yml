The first thing to do before starting coding a project is building the continuous deployment. Why? It doesn't matter how great you built a software if customers can't see it, also having an enviroment ready to all developers publish what they're doing for testing and early customer feedback is essential.

First, you should create where you project will be hosted. I'm gonna use AWS S3
